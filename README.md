## Summary

This is the Android SDK of adjust™. You can read more about adjust™ at
adjust.com.

## Basic Installation

These are the minimal steps required to integrate the adjust SDK into your
Android project. We are going to assume that you use Eclipse for your Android
development.

### 1. Get the SDK

Download the latest version from our [releases page][releases]. Extract the
archive in a folder of your choice.

### 2. Create the Adjust project

In the Eclipse menu select `File → New → Project...`.

![][project]

From the Wizard expand the `Android` group and select `Android Project from
Existing Code` and click `Next`.

![][android]

On the top of the next screen click the `Browse...` button and locate the
folder you extracted in step 1. Select the Adjust subfolder and click `Open`.
In the `Projects:` group make sure the Adjust project is selected. Also tick
the option `Copy projects into workspace` and click `Finish`.

![][import]

### 3. Add the adjust library to your project

In the Package Explorer right click on your Android project and select
`Properties`.

![][properties]

In the left pane select `Android`. In the bottom right group `Library` click
the `Add...` button. From the list select the Adjust library project and
click `OK`. Save your changed project properties by clicking `OK` again.

![][library]

### 4. Add permissions

In the Package Explorer open the `AndroidManifest.xml` of your Android project.
Add the `uses-permission` tags for `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` if they
aren't present already.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
```

![][permissions]

### 5. Add Adjust settings

Still in the `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following `meta-data` tags inside
the `application` tag.

```xml
<meta-data android:name="AdjustAppToken"    android:value="{YourAppToken}" />
<meta-data android:name="AdjustLogLevel"    android:value="info" />
<meta-data android:name="AdjustEnvironment" android:value="sandbox" /> <!-- TODO: change to 'production' -->
```

![][settings]

Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your App Token. You can find in your [dashboard].

You can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see by changing the value
of `AdjustLogLevel` to one of the following:

- `verbose` - enable all logging
- `debug` - enable more logging
- `info` - the default
- `warn` - disable info logging
- `error` - disable warnings as well
- `assert` - disable errors as well

Depending on whether or not you build your app for testing or for production
you must adjust the `AdjustEnvironment` setting:

- `sandbox` - for testing
- `production` - before publishing

**Important:** This value should be set to `sandbox` if and only if you or
someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment to
`production` just before you publish the app. Set it back to `sandbox` when you
start testing it again.

We use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and artificial
traffic from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value
meaningful at all times! Especially if you are tracking revenue.

### 6. Add broadcast receiver

Still in your `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following `receiver` tag inside
the `application` tag.

```xml
<receiver
    android:name="com.adjust.sdk.ReferrerReceiver"
    android:exported="true" >
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

![][receiver]

We use this broadcast receiver to retrieve the install referrer to improve
conversion tracking.

If you are already using a different broadcast receiver for the
`INSTALL_REFERRER` intent, follow [these instructions][referrer] to add the
Adjust receiver.

### 7. Integrate adjust into your app

To provide proper session tracking it is required to call certain Adjust
methods every time any Activity resumes or pauses. Otherwise the SDK might miss
a session start or session end. In order to do so you should follow these steps
for **each** Activity of your app:

- Open the source file of your Activity.
- Add the `import` statement at the top of the file.
- In your Activity's `onResume` method call `Adjust.onResume`. Create the
  method if needed.
- In your Activity's `onPause` method call `Adjust.onPause`. Create the
  method if needed.

After these steps your activity should look like this:

```java
import com.adjust.sdk.Adjust;
// ...
public class YourActivity extends Activity {
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        Adjust.onResume(this);
    }
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        Adjust.onPause();
    }
    // ...
}
```

![][activity]

Repeat these steps for **every** Activity of your app. Don't forget these steps
when you create new Activities in the future. Depending on your coding style
you might want to implement this in a common superclass of all your Activities.

### 8. Build your app

Build and run your Android app. In your LogCat viewer you can set the filter
`tag:Adjust` to hide all other logs. After your app has launched you should
see the following Adjust log: `Tracked session start`

![][log]

## Additional Features

Once you have integrated the adjust SDK into your project, you can take
advantage of the following features.

### 9. Add tracking of custom events.

You can tell adjust about every event you want. Suppose you want to track
every tap on a button. You would have to create a new Event Token in your
[dashboard]. Let's say that Event Token is `abc123`. In your button's `onClick`
method you could then add the following line to track the click:

```java
Adjust.trackEvent("abc123");
```

You can also register a callback URL for that event in your [dashboard] and we
will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event gets tracked. In that
case you can also put some key-value-pairs in a dictionary and pass it to the
`trackEvent` method. We will then append these named parameters to your
callback URL.

For example, suppose you have registered the URL
`http://www.adjust.com/callback` for your event with Event Token `abc123` and
execute the following lines:

```java
Map<String, String> parameters = new HashMap<String, String>();
parameters.put("key", "value");
parameters.put("foo", "bar");
Adjust.trackEvent("abc123", parameters);
```

In that case we would track the event and send a request to:

    http://www.adjust.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar

It should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like
`{android_id}` that can be used as parameter values. In the resulting callback
this placeholder would be replaced with the AndroidID of the current device.
Also note that we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only append
them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an event,
these parameters won't even be read.

### 10. Add tracking of revenue

If your users can generate revenue by clicking on advertisements or making
purchases you can track those revenues. If, for example, a click is worth one
cent, you could make the following call to track that revenue:

```java
Adjust.trackRevenue(1.0);
```

The parameter is supposed to be in cents and will get rounded to one decimal
point. If you want to differentiate between different kinds of revenue you can
get different Event Tokens for each kind. Again, you need to create those Event
Tokens in your [dashboard]. In that case you would make a call like this:

```java
Adjust.trackRevenue(1.0, "abc123");
```

Again, you can register a callback and provide a dictionary of named
parameters, just like it worked with normal events.

```java
Map<String, String> parameters = new HashMap<String, String>();
parameters.put("key", "value");
parameters.put("foo", "bar");
Adjust.trackRevenue(1.0, "abc123", parameters);
```

### 11. Set listener for delegate notifications

Every time your app tries to track a session, an event or some revenue, you can
be notified about the success of that operation and receive additional
information about the current install.

Please make sure to consider [applicable attribution data policies.][attribution-data]

The simplest way is to create a single anonymous listener for these notifications.

- Open the source file of your main activity, find its `onResume` method and
  add the following code below your `Adjust.onResume` call:

    ```java
    Adjust.onResume(this);

    Adjust.setOnFinishedListener(new OnFinishedListener() {
        public void onFinishedTracking(ResponseData responseData) {
        }
    });
    ```

- Alternatively, you could implement the `OnFinishedListener` interface in your
  activity and pass the activity:

    ```java
    Adjust.setOnFinishedListener(this);
    ```

This `OnClickListener` will only be set if this activity has been active
before. You can set it in all activities to make sure that it is always set,
regardless of what activities have been active. In this case it makes sense to
implement the `OnClickListener` interface in one class and set the listener to
the same object in every `onResume` method.

The listener method `onFinishedTracking` will get called every time any
activity was tracked or failed to track. Within this listener function you have
access to the `responseData` parameter. Here is a quick summary of its
interface:

- `ActivityKind getActivityKind()` indicates what kind of activity
  was tracked. Returns one of these values:

    ```java
    ActivityKind.SESSION
    ActivityKind.EVENT
    ActivityKind.REVENUE
    ```

- `String getActivityKindString()` human readable version of the activity kind. Possible values:

    ```
    session
    event
    revenue
    ```

- `boolean wasSuccess()` indicates whether or not the tracking attempt was
  successful.
- `boolean willRetry()` is true when the request failed, but will be
  retried.
- `String getError()` an error message when the activity failed to track or
  the response could not be parsed. Is `null` otherwise.
- `String getTrackerToken()` the tracker token of the current install. Is `null` if
  request failed or response could not be parsed.
- `String getTrackerName()` the tracker name of the current install. Is `null` if
  request failed or response could not be parsed.

### 12. Enable event buffering

If your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some
HTTP requests in order to send them in one batch every minute. You can enable
event buffering by adding the following line to your Adjust settings in your
`AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```xml
<meta-data android:name="AdjustEventBuffering" android:value="true" />
```

### 13. Disable tracking

You can disable the adjust SDK from tracking by invoking the method
`setEnabled` with the enabled parameter as `false`. This setting is remembered
between sessions, but it can only be activated after the first session.

```java
Adjust.setEnabled(false);
```

You can verify if the adjust SDK is currently active with the method
`isEnabled`. It is always possible to activate the adjust SDK by invoking
`setEnable` with the enabled parameter as `true`.

### 14. Handle deep linking

You can also set up the adjust SDK to read deep links that come to your app. We
will only read the data that is injected by adjust tracker URLs. This is
essential if you are planning to run retargeting or re-engagement campaigns
with deep links.

For each activity that accepts deep links, find the `onCreate` method and add
the folowing call to adjust:

```java
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    Intent intent = getIntent();
    Uri data = intent.getData();
    Adjust.appWillOpenUrl(data);
    //...
}
```
